    "Now you are ready to install the main dependency and framework: [DIALS](https://dials.github.io). After installing that, you can install `laue-dials` using pip, as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge dials\n",
    "pip install laue-dials\n",
    "```\n",

    "All other dependencies will then be automatically installed for you, and you'll be ready to analyze your first Laue data set! Reopen this notebook with the appropriate environment activated when ready.\n",

    "# Getting an Initial Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "After importing our data, the first thing we need to do is get an initial estimate for the experimental geometry. Here, we'll use some monochromatic algorithms from DIALS to help! This step can be tricky -- failure can be due to several causes. In the event of failure, here are a few common causes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The spotfinding gain is either too high or too low. Try looking at the results of `dials.image_viewer imported.expt strong.refl` and seeing if you have too many (or too few) reflections. Lower gain gives you more spots, but also more likely to give false positives.\n",
    "2. Supplying the space group or unit cell during indexing can be helpful. When supplying the unit cell, allow for some variation in the lengths of the axes, since the monochromatic algorithms may result in a slightly scaled unit cell depending on the chosen wavelength.\n",
    "3. You may have intensities that need to be masked. These can come from bad panels or extraneous scatter. You can use `dials.image_viewer` (described below) to create a mask file for your data, and then provide the `spotfinder.lookup.mask=\"pixels.mask\"` command below to use that mask during spotfinding."

    "# Viewing Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's helpful to be able to see the analysis data overlayed on the raw data. DIALS has a utility for viewing spot information on the raw images called `dials.image_viewer`. For example, the spotfinding gain parameter can be tuned to capture more spots, but lowering it too much finds nonexistent spots. To check this, we can use the image viewer to see what spots were found on images. We need to provide an `expt` file and a `refl` file -- the `imported.expt` and `strong.refl` files will do for checking spotfinding. This program also has utilities for generating masks if they are needed. The red dots from the checkbox \"Mark centers of mass\" are the spots found by `laue.find_spots` (which in turn makes a call to `dials.find_spots`). These are best used for judging whether you need to adjust the gain higher (for fewer spots) or lower (for more) during spotfinding. You can find more details on the image viewer in the [DIALS tutorial here](https://dials.github.io/documentation/tutorials/processing_in_detail_betalactamase.html)."

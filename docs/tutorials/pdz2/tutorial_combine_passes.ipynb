    "With Anaconda, we can then create and activate a custom environment for your install by running  \n",

    "```\n",
    "conda create --name laue-dials\n",
    "conda activate laue-dials\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to install the main dependency and framework: [DIALS](https://dials.github.io). After installing that, we can install `laue-dials` using pip, as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge dials\n",
    "pip install laue-dials\n",
    "```\n",

    "All other dependencies will then be automatically installed for us, and we'll be ready to analyze your first Laue data set! Reopen this notebook with the appropriate environment activated when ready.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Introduction\n",

    "    \n",
    "The data is comprised of four passes of four timepoints each. Each of the four electric-field timepoints is taken for a given `phi` angle, then the crystal is rotated aaround the phi goniometer axis and then the four timepoints are taken again. This is done over four passes, `c,d,e,f`. The start angle and the step can be found in the below table. \n",

    "At the end of processing, we would like four `.mtz` files, one for each timepoint. We must run `laue-dials` on each timepoint individually, then combine all passes for a given timepoint at the end. We start with the `off` timepoint pass `c` only. Then, we will analyze all sixteen passes in a single script, and combine the output mtzs into a single mtz file. \n",

Feel free to use any data set you'd like below, but a [sample time-resolved EF-X data set](https://zenodo.org/record/6407157) has been uploaded to Zenodo for your convenience, and this notebook has been tested using that dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create two dictionaries, `START_ANGLES` and `OSCS`, that respectively map the pass names to the start angles and rotation steps (treated as oscillations in `dials.import)`. \n",

This step can be tricky -- failure can be due to several causes. In the event of failure, here are a few common causes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The spotfinding gain is either too high or too low. Try looking at the results of `dials.image_viewer imported.expt strong.refl` and seeing if you have too many (or too few) reflections. Lower gain gives you more spots, but also more likely to give false positives.\n",
    "2. Supplying the space group or unit cell during indexing can be helpful. When supplying the unit cell, allow for some variation in the lengths of the axes, since the monochromatic algorithms may result in a slightly scaled unit cell depending on the chosen wavelength.\n",
    "3. You may have intensities that need to be masked. These can come from bad panels or extraneous scatter. You can use `dials.image_viewer` (described below) to create a mask file for your data, and then provide the `spotfinder.lookup.mask=\"pixels.mask\"` command below to use that mask during spotfinding."

    "# Viewing Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's helpful to be able to see the analysis data overlayed on the raw data. DIALS has a utility for viewing spot information on the raw images called `dials.image_viewer`. For example, the spotfinding gain parameter can be tuned to capture more spots, but lowering it too much finds nonexistent spots. To check this, we can use the image viewer to see what spots were found on images. We need to provide an `expt` file and a `refl` file -- the `imported.expt` and `strong.refl` files will do for checking spotfinding. This program also has utilities for generating masks if they are needed. The red dots from the checkbox \"Mark centers of mass\" are the spots found by `laue.find_spots` (which in turn makes a call to `dials.find_spots`). These are best used for judging whether you need to adjust the gain higher (for fewer spots) or lower (for more) during spotfinding. You can find more details on the image viewer in the [DIALS tutorial here](https://dials.github.io/documentation/tutorials/processing_in_detail_betalactamase.html)."

    "At this point, you now have integrated `mtz` files that you can pass to [careless](https://github.com/rs-station/careless) for scaling and merging. We provide an example `careless` script, found at `../scripts/careless-cdef-ohp-mlpw.sh`. However, after all Laue-DIALS files are printed out, `../scripts/reduce.sh` can also be run for a complete analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that throughout this pipeline, you can use DIALS utilities like `dials.image_viewer` or `dials.report` to check progress and ensure your data is being analyzed properly. We recommend regularly checking the analysis by looking at the data on images, which can be done by\n",
    "\n",
    "`dials.image_viewer FILE.expt FILE.refl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These files are generally written as pairs with the same base name, with the exception of combining `imported.expt` + `strong.refl`, or `poly_refined.expt` + `predicted.refl`.\n",

    "Also note that you can take any program and enter it on the command-line for further help. For example, writing\n",
